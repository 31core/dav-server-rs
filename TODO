- research why UNLOCK fails with 4xx on OSX

- If: header support in conditional.rs
- Add a real locksystem interface, and a "memls"

  scalable extended attributes. ext2/3/4 can store max 4KB. On XFS we can
  then also store creationdate in an attribute.

- Add support for setting mtime/atime

- score 100% against the litmus test :)

- move filesystem interface to pathbuf

- support for compressing responses, at least PROPFIND.
- support for compressed PUT requests?

- cache-control headers?

- add documentation
- add tests, tests ...

- port to hyper 0.11

DONE:

  linux quota and NFS rquota.
